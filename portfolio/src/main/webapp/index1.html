      <p>I’m a Houston-raised developer with a 
          strong design background, I’m proud of my 
          versatile skillset and am excited to work on 
          any projects that need me. I’m a team player 
          who empathizes with those working alongside me, 
          and I’m often described as someone who is a 
          critical thinker, strong decision maker, and 
          visual communicator.</p>
